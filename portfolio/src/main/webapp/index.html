      <h2>About Me:</h2>
      <p>
          I am a rising junior computer science major at morehouse college.
          I was born in south carolina to two military officers. I have one older brother who just graduated from the United States Military at West Point.
          I grew up in Chicago,IL and played football untill I graduated from high school. My last two years of highschool I was able to learn more about 
          computer scince which helped lead me to the feild of study. I want to become a software engineer. My interest in the field of software would be 
          Front-end Web Development. I enjoy learning about how computers developed over time. I am still learning the more complex parts of computer 
          programming but have master the basics. So far I have learned more about how to test mathematical algorithms, and other math that is involved 
          in computer science.
      </p>
      <h2>Projects:</h2>
      <p>
          <b>Community Work: </b>This past year I've been working with the Morehouse College research department, and there Culturally Relevant 
          Research Lab to create lesson plans that can be used to teach other students from kindergarten through 12th grade. The last two weeks in December the 
          research lab went to a foster home in Alabama to run a week long class. The kids that were older we gave a class in JavaScript which helped them 
          learn the basics. Younger kids we had them program basic robots.   
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Personal Projects and Research: </b>I have been learning more about Data Science and Machine Learning. I have learned a lot more about how nural networks can be 
             used to catagorize images, and objects in those images. I've used software such as MatLabe to program scripts and executables that can render videos 
             frame by fram in order to detect what image is being shown in each frame. Other lab developments have been being able to detect images in real time.
             the end goal is to be able to advance computer vision so that machines can better interact with its surondings. 
      </p>
      <h2>Outside of Computer Science:</h2>

          <b>ROTC: </b>I am an Army ROTC cadet at morehouse college which is helping me achive my goal of becoming an Army officer. Through ROTC I have been able to work outside
          and in nature. ROTC has provided me the opportunity to to give back to my comunity. My ROTC departments helps preserve many of the parks around the Atlanta area. 
      </p>
      <p>
          <b>Interest in nature: </b>I live in maryland which is a very unique area seeing as it is very close to DC national parks, and maryland hiking trails. In recent memory, 
          the most interesting I have gone would be the Botanical Garden in downtown DC. It had tons of interesting, and exotic plants. I also enjoy hiking. Maryland has many hiking trails
          that go through much of the country.
